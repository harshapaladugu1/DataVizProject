    "Project topic: Digital fraud has been one of the biggest illegal markets in recent times. From black market websites selling credit card information to fishing messages trying to access your personal information, financial fraud is a big issue that currently needs to be tackled. Our project will be looking over a Kaggle database that presents different features of online transactions. This training data has a column with a boolean value of 0 or 1 telling us whether or not the transaction is fraudulent. With this information, we plan on finding trends within the data that tell us what factors most contribute to fraud.\n",

    "What are indicators of credit card fraud attempts? \n",

    "Description of potential source data: \n",
    "\"We present a synthetic dataset generated using the simulator called PaySim as an approach to such a problem. PaySim uses aggregated data from the private dataset to generate a synthetic dataset that resembles the normal operation of transactions and injects malicious behaviour to later evaluate the performance of fraud detection methods.\"\n",
